 * Description: This plugin will install a Wikio-Button, to vote for your posts on wikio.de. Based on the wikioVote-Script (by Wikio), edited by H.-Peter Pfeufer. Vote for articles on the wikio site.<strong>Wikio is now a shoppingportal and Wikiolabs is now ebuzzing. So the buttons won't work anymore and this plugin can be uninstalled.</strong>
